# NeuralNetwork Library
## Overview
The NeuralNetwork library is a simple implementation of a neural network in C#. This library includes a neural network class with various activation functions and training methods, as well as a utility class for generating random data to simulate a fruit classification problem.

# Features
Neural Network: Implementation of a neural network with one hidden layer.
Activation Functions: Supports Sigmoid, Hyperbolic Tangent, and ReLu activation functions.
Training: Includes a simple training method using random search and regularization.
Data Generation: Generates random data for a fruit classification problem (poisonous vs non-poisonous).

# Getting Started
## Prerequisites
.NET SDK

## Installation
### Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/NoahGram/NeuralNetwork.git
cd NeuralNetwork

### Build the project:
dotnet build

#Usage
The main entry point of the application is the Program class, which creates and trains a neural network, and then uses it to predict whether fruits are poisonous based on their characteristics.
